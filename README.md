Building to a given specification (the Application Programmer Interface, or API) and verifying correctness of the implementation are important concerns in software engineering. APIs establish a sort of contract between the creators and users of a software library about its expected behavior and functionality. The interface also allows developers to separate the concerns of design and implementation of large projects. Early on, design can proceed without distraction from the details of implementation by instead producing a specification of required components and their interfaces. Later, the implementation of each module can proceed more independently from the design of the project as a whole.
